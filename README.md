# Advanced-Cpp
This repository contains laboratories and projects completed during the **Advanced C++** course at CentraleSupélec (2025/2026)

## Lab 01: Petri networks
The first lab introduces fundamental C++ concepts such as **structs**, **header and source files** (.hpp / .cpp), the **compilation process**, and **memory management**.
It also explores different **data types** and **STL containers** through the implementation of Petri nets — a mathematical formalism used to model systems where *multiple tasks run in parallel* and may need to access shared resources sequentially.
While Petri nets are often used to describe **communication protocols**, in this lab they mainly serve as a hands-on way to experiment with concurrency modeling.

## Lab 02: Logical Circuits
The second lab focuses on **functional programming** in C++, including function manipulation, **lambda expressions**, and the ranges library.
The goal is to construct **logical circuits** starting from basic components such as wires, then combining them into logic gates and, ultimately, into complete circuits.
